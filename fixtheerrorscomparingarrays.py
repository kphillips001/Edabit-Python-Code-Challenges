# Programmer Pete is trying to create a function that returns True if two lists share the same length and have identical numerical values at every index, otherwise, it will return False.

# However, the solution his function gives is in an unexpected format. Can you fix Pete's function so that it behaves as seen in the examples below?
def check_equals(lst1, lst2):
	return lst1 == lst2
