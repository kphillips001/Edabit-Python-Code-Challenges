# The ternary operator (sometimes called Conditional Expressions) in python is an alternative to the if... else... statement.

# It is written in the format:

# result_if_true if condition else result_if_false
# Ternary operators are often more compact than multi-line if statements, and are useful for simple conditional tests.
